The official ComfyUI custom node suite for **[Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai/)** with full **BYOP (Bring Your Own Pollen)** support. 

Generate high-quality images, text, and videos using state-of-the-art models (like **Flux**, **DeepSeek**, and **Wan 2.6**) directly inside ComfyUI—**without using any of your local GPU VRAM.** 

Whether you are running on an 8GB laptop or a cloud server, this node suite offloads the heavy compute lifting to the Pollinations API.

## ✨ Features
* **Zero Local VRAM Required:** Generation happens entirely in the cloud.
* **Multimodal Generation:** Create Images, Videos, and Text all from within your node tree.
* **BYOP Support:** Seamlessly integrate your Pollinations API Key to use your own "Pollen" quota, bypassing anonymous rate limits and supporting the ecosystem.
* **Lightning Fast:** Outputs load directly as standard ComfyUI `IMAGE` and `STRING` formats, ready for immediate downstream processing (Upscaling, I2V, Compositing).

## 🔑 How to get your API Key (BYOP)

Pollinations operates on a unique **"Pollen"** economy. While anonymous generation is free, it is heavily rate-limited. By using your own API key, you unlock your personal daily/weekly free Pollen grants, allowing for faster and more consistent generation.

1. Go to **[enter.pollinations.ai](https://enter.pollinations.ai/)**.
2. Sign in using your Discord or Google account.
3. Once logged in, your API key will be visible on your dashboard.
4. Copy the key and paste it into the `api_key` field of the ComfyUI node.
5. *That's it! Your ComfyUI workflow is now fueled by your own Pollen.*

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does this cost money?**  
**A:** No! Pollinations provides free anonymous generations, and every registered user receives a free allowance of "Pollen" every week. You only pay if you decide to scale up massively and buy extra Pollen.

**Q: Why does my generation fail or timeout?**  
**A:** If you are leaving the `api_key` field blank, you are using the anonymous public tier, which can experience high traffic or strict rate limits. **Adding your free API key solves this.**

**Q: Does this download large models to my hard drive?**  
**A:** No. This is a pure API node. Your local installation size will remain exactly the same, making it perfect for budget 8GB VRAM setups.

**Q: Can I chain these nodes together?**  
**A:** Yes! A popular workflow is to use the **Text Gen** node to expand a simple idea into a highly detailed visual prompt, then feed that string directly into the **Image Gen** node, and finally pass that image output into a Video generation node.
